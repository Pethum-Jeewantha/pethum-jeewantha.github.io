- I have developed an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework using Java that utilizes Reflections and Annotation. 
- This framework can create database tables based on the structure of Java classes. It provides a way to map object-oriented data models to relational databases and eliminates the need to write complex SQL statements.
- The framework is designed to simplify the process of database management and improve application performance. 
- This project demonstrates my understanding of Java programming and my ability to develop robust and efficient frameworks. 
- As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to adding more advanced features to the ORM framework and making it even more powerful.
