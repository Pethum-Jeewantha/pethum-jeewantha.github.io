- I designed a Point of Sale (POS) system using the AdminLTE framework for the front-end interface. 
- The system is designed to help small businesses manage their sales, inventory, and customers. 
- The website is hosted at [here](https://pethumjeewantha.com/html-css-pos-system) and provides users with a clean, user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. 
- This project demonstrates my ability to create intuitive and efficient user interfaces for web applications, as well as my understanding of front-end web development frameworks. 
- As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to adding more advanced features to the POS system, such as data analytics and reporting.
