- I designed a Twitter clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is hosted at [here](https://pethumjeewantha.com/vanilla-html-css-twitter-clone) and features a user interface that is very similar to the Twitter platform.
- This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop web applications, as well as my understanding of front-end web development technologies. 
- I am proud of the functionality I have been able to implement in this project and look forward to continuing to improve and enhance it in the future.
