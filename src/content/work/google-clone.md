- I designed a Google clone that is integrated with Google custom search engine, using just HTML and CSS. The website is hosted at [here](https://pethumjeewantha.com/vanilla-html-css-google-clone) and provides users with a search engine that delivers relevant search results tailored to their needs. 
- This project demonstrates my web development skills and ability to use APIs to integrate external services into web applications.
- As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to enhancing the functionality of the Google clone with more advanced features, such as user registration and personalized search results.
