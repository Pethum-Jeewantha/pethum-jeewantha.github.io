- This text editor is capable of reading text files, providing a user-friendly interface for editing and formatting text, and supporting essential features such as find and replace
functionality. 
- It allows users to efficiently modify the content of TXT files and save the changes seamlessly. 
- This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using JavaFX.
- As I continue to enhance my skills, I look forward to expanding the functionality of the text editor and
incorporating additional features to make it even more versatile and user-friendly.
