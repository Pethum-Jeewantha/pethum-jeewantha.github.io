- I designed a simple intro user interface (UI) using JavaScript. 
- The UI is designed to provide users with an engaging introduction to a website or application. 
- The website is hosted at [here](https://pethumjeewantha.com/simple-intro) and features a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. 
- This project demonstrates my ability to create engaging and interactive UI designs for web applications, as well as my understanding of front-end web development technologies. 
- As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to creating more complex UI designs and adding more advanced features to the intro UI.
